# Minimal Monorepo for LLM Prototyping

minimal monorepo for fast prototyping. cli interface initiates:
- new git repo with gitignore for python and macos
- new minimal conda env yml file with all deps pinned
- python wrapper for various llm providers - start with gemini, openrouter and local inference (start with ollama) but must be extensible further, which exposes a minimal sdk by importing which i can do,
class SomeResponseSchema(Basemodel)
  ...definition
LLMPROVIDER = "provider"
agent = agent(llmprovider, responseschdma)
prompt = "prompt {stuff}"
response = agent(prompt)
logger.info(response)  # includes json, token usage - all logs go into logs/yyyy/mm/dd/script_filename.log
- empty python notebook to run experiments
- env is loaded from dotenv and gitignored
- prompts must be versioned
- responses must be saved to responses as yaml files with ability to add ground truth and names for custom eval tests which can be pass test, eg
evals:
  HAS_NO_SHIT_IN_RESPONSE: fail
- run evals must be implemented off the shelf, which looks for any eval test values and ground truth available from yaml files, with one command all yaml files are reviewed all data collected, metrics calculated (like confusion matrix or intersection over union) and heatmap printed
- evals must be implemented to be able to run multiple times, iterate and version them
- all response yamls also contain inference provider (eg google genai, ollama etc), model name, inference date, link to versioned prompt(s) and versioned pydantic response model

I'll create a minimal monorepo for fast LLM prototyping with all the features you requested. This will be a comprehensive CLI tool that sets up everything you need.

continue artifact exactly where you left. dont rewrite anything

## Claude

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive LLM prototyping monorepo CLI that includes all the features you requested. Here's what it provides:

#### Key Features

##### üöÄ Quick Setup

- Single command creates entire project structure with git repo
- Conda environment with pinned dependencies
- Pre-configured gitignore for Python/macOS
##### ü§ñ Unified LLM Provider SDK

- Extensible architecture - Easy to add new providers
- Current providers: Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama
- Simple interface:
pythonfrom llm_provider import agent
llm_agent = agent("gemini", ResponseSchema)
response = llm_agent("your prompt")
##### üìä Response Management

- Automatic response saving as YAML files
- Each response includes: content, model, provider, timestamp, token usage, prompt hash
- Versioned prompts with SHA256 hashing
##### üß™ Built-in Evaluation System

- Pre-built evaluators: content filtering, length checks, ground truth comparison
- Custom evaluators: Easy to add via CLI or code
- Comprehensive metrics: confusion matrices, pass rates, score distributions
- Rich visualizations: Heatmaps, bar charts, histograms
##### üìù Automatic Logging

- Structured logging to logs/yyyy/mm/dd/script_filename.log
`logs/yyyy/mm/dd/script_filename.log`- JSON formatted logs with token usage and metadata
##### üéØ Usage Example

##### üîç Evaluation Workflow

- Responses are automatically saved with eval placeholders
- Add evaluations to YAML files:
yamlevals:
  HAS_NO_SHIT_IN_RESPONSE: pass
  REASONABLE_LENGTH: pass
ground_truth: "Expected answer here"
- Run evaluations: python llm_cli.py run-evals
`python llm_cli.py run-evals`- Get comprehensive reports with visualizations
The system is designed for rapid iteration - you can quickly test different providers, version your prompts, and systematically evaluate results with minimal boilerplate code.
