whats the difference if i set arg in def, prompt: List[str], or if i set prompt: List[str] (list lowercase)? give very concise to the point answer

## Model

The type hint `List[str]` (uppercase "L") refers to the type from the `typing` module, which is the correct way to type-hint a list in Python.

`list[str]` (lowercase "l") is a built-in type hint available in Python 3.9 and later, offering a more concise syntax for the same purpose.

In Python versions prior to 3.9, `list[str]` would result in a `TypeError`.

ok now a different question. i have some class definition that i'm not ready to use yet. how can i raise not implemented error whenever anyone tries to use class? only give short to the point response in code

## Model

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("MyClass is not ready for use yet.")

    def my_method(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("MyClass is not ready for use yet.")

# Example of how it would prevent instantiation and method calls
# try:
#     obj = MyClass()
# except NotImplementedError as e:
#     print(e)

# try:
#     obj = MyClass() # This line would still raise NotImplementedError
#     obj.my_method()
# except NotImplementedError as e:
#     print(e)

## User

is there a way to sort of raise it class wide?

## Model

Yes, the most Pythonic and effective way to "raise it class-wide" for a class that's not ready is to use **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)** from the `abc` module.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class MyAbstractClass(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def __init__(self):
        # You can still have initialization logic, but instantiation will fail
        # if abstract methods are not implemented in subclasses.
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def some_required_method(self):
        pass

    def a_concrete_method(self):
        # This method can be implemented even if the class is abstract
        print("This method is implemented.")

# Attempting to instantiate MyAbstractClass directly will raise a TypeError
# try:
#     obj = MyAbstractClass()
# except TypeError as e:
#     print(e)

# To use it, you must create a subclass and implement the abstract methods
class MyConcreteClass(MyAbstractClass):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        print("MyConcreteClass initialized.")

    def some_required_method(self):
        print("some_required_method implemented in MyConcreteClass.")

# This will work
obj = MyConcreteClass()
obj.some_required_method()
obj.a_concrete_method()

# If you forget to implement an abstract method in a subclass:
# class AnotherIncompleteClass(MyAbstractClass):
#     def __init__(self):
#         super().__init__()
#         print("AnotherIncompleteClass initialized.")

# This would also raise a TypeError:
# try:
#     incomplete_obj = AnotherIncompleteClass()
# except TypeError as e:
#     print(e)
```

**Explanation:**

* **`from abc import ABC, abstractmethod`**: Imports the necessary components for creating abstract classes.
* **`class MyAbstractClass(ABC):`**: Declares `MyAbstractClass` as an Abstract Base Class by inheriting from `ABC`.
* **`@abstractmethod`**: This decorator marks a method as abstract.
    * If any method in a class is decorated with `@abstractmethod`, that class automatically becomes an abstract class.
    * **Crucially, you cannot directly instantiate an abstract class.** If you try, Python will raise a `TypeError` indicating that abstract methods need to be implemented.
    * Subclasses *must* implement all abstract methods from their abstract parent class before they can be instantiated. If a subclass fails to implement an abstract method, it remains abstract itself, and cannot be instantiated.

This approach provides a much stronger "class-wide" enforcement than manually raising `NotImplementedError` in every method or in the `__init__`, as it prevents instantiation of the class (and any incomplete subclasses) at the time of creation, forcing the developer to complete the implementation.

## User

no i would still like to raise NotImplementedError but somehow for all methods of class at once. it is not an abstract class just not ready to be used yet. give me simple straightforward solution in code and dont write anything else

## Model

Here's a simple way to achieve that using a custom metaclass:

```python
class NotReadyMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith('__'):
                dct[attr_name] = NotReadyMeta.raise_not_implemented_wrapper(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def raise_not_implemented_wrapper(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            raise NotImplementedError(f"Class '{args[0].__class__.__name__}' is not ready for use yet. Method '{func.__name__}' is not implemented.")
        return wrapper

class MyClass(metaclass=NotReadyMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        print("MyClass __init__ called (but will raise NotImplementedError if not overridden)")

    def some_method(self):
        pass

    def another_method(self, arg):
        pass

# Attempting to use MyClass will raise NotImplementedError for any method call
# try:
#     obj = MyClass()
# except NotImplementedError as e:
#     print(e)

# try:
#     obj = MyClass()
#     obj.some_method()
# except NotImplementedError as e:
#     print(e)

# try:
#     obj = MyClass()
#     obj.another_method(1)
# except NotImplementedError as e:
#     print(e)

# If you need specific methods to work, you can override them in a subclass
class MyReadyClass(MyClass):
    def __init__(self):
        print("MyReadyClass initialized.")

    def some_method(self):
        print("some_method is now implemented in MyReadyClass.")

    # another_method would still raise NotImplementedError if not overridden here
    # def another_method(self, arg):
    #     print(f"another_method with arg: {arg}")

ready_obj = MyReadyClass()
ready_obj.some_method()
# ready_obj.another_method(5) # This would still raise NotImplementedError
```

## Model

A `TypeError: metaclass conflict` occurs when a class inherits from multiple base classes, and those base classes (or the class itself) have different metaclasses that are not compatible (i.e., one is not a subclass of the other).

In your specific case, `OpenRouterProvider` is trying to use `NotReadyMeta` as its metaclass, but `BaseLLMProvider` likely also has its own metaclass (or implicitly uses `type` which `NotReadyMeta` itself inherits from).

To resolve this, your `NotReadyMeta` needs to be aware of and compatible with the metaclass of `BaseLLMProvider`.

**Solution:**

The most robust way to handle this is to make your custom `NotReadyMeta` inherit from the metaclass of `BaseLLMProvider`. You'll need to identify what `BaseLLMProvider`'s metaclass is.

Let's assume `BaseLLMProvider` itself uses a metaclass (let's call it `BaseLLMMeta`), or it doesn't explicitly define one, in which case its metaclass is `type`.

**Option 1: If `BaseLLMProvider`'s metaclass is `type` (the default)**

Your `NotReadyMeta` already inherits from `type`, so this shouldn't be the direct cause of the conflict. However, the error message indicates a conflict. This might happen if `BaseLLMProvider` is implicitly defining a metaclass or if there's another base class in `BaseLLMProvider`'s hierarchy that has a custom metaclass.

**Option 2: If `BaseLLMProvider` has a custom metaclass (e.g., `BaseLLMMeta`)**

You need to modify `NotReadyMeta` to inherit from `BaseLLMMeta`.

```python
# Assuming BaseLLMProvider's metaclass is BaseLLMMeta
# You would need to import BaseLLMMeta if it's defined elsewhere.

# from some_module import BaseLLMMeta # Example: if BaseLLMMeta is defined elsewhere

class NotReadyMeta(BaseLLMMeta): # <-- Change 'type' to 'BaseLLMMeta'
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith('__'):
                dct[attr_name] = NotReadyMeta.raise_not_implemented_wrapper(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def raise_not_implemented_wrapper(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            raise NotImplementedError(f"Class '{args[0].__class__.__name__}' is not ready for use yet. Method '{func.__name__}' is not implemented.")
        return wrapper

# Then, your class definition remains the same:
# class OpenRouterProvider(BaseLLMProvider, metaclass=NotReadyMeta):
#     # ...
```

**How to find `BaseLLMProvider`'s metaclass:**

You can inspect `BaseLLMProvider` to find its metaclass:

```python
# In your code, before defining OpenRouterProvider
print(type(BaseLLMProvider))
```

This will output something like `<class 'abc.ABCMeta'>` (if it's an ABC) or `<class 'type'>`. Once you know what it is, use that as the base for `NotReadyMeta`.

**Most common scenario:** If `BaseLLMProvider` is an Abstract Base Class (ABC), its metaclass will be `abc.ABCMeta`. In that case, your `NotReadyMeta` should inherit from `ABCMeta`.

```python
from abc import ABCMeta # Import if BaseLLMProvider is an ABC

class NotReadyMeta(ABCMeta): # Inherit from ABCMeta
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith('__'):
                dct[attr_name] = NotReadyMeta.raise_not_implemented_wrapper(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def raise_not_implemented_wrapper(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            raise NotImplementedError(f"Class '{args[0].__class__.__name__}' is not ready for use yet. Method '{func.__name__}' is not implemented.")
        return wrapper

# Then, your class definition:
# class OpenRouterProvider(BaseLLMProvider, metaclass=NotReadyMeta):
#     """OpenRouter provider"""
#     def __init__(self, model: str = "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", **kwargs):
```
The `TypeError: metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases` error occurs when you attempt to create a class that inherits from multiple base classes, and those base classes themselves have different metaclasses.

In your specific case:

```python
class OpenRouterProvider(BaseLLMProvider, metaclass=NotReadyMeta):
    """OpenRouter provider"""
    def __init__(self, model: str = "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", **kwargs):
```

You are trying to apply `NotReadyMeta` as the metaclass to `OpenRouterProvider`. However, `OpenRouterProvider` also inherits from `BaseLLMProvider`. It's highly likely that `BaseLLMProvider` (or one of its own base classes) already defines its own metaclass.

**The problem:** Python needs to determine a single metaclass for `OpenRouterProvider`. When `BaseLLMProvider` has a metaclass (let's call it `MetaA`) and you explicitly specify `NotReadyMeta` for `OpenRouterProvider`, Python tries to find a metaclass for `OpenRouterProvider` that is a subclass of *both* `MetaA` and `NotReadyMeta`. If `MetaA` and `NotReadyMeta` are unrelated (i.e., neither is a subclass of the other), Python cannot resolve this conflict and raises the `TypeError`.

**Solution:**

To resolve this, your `NotReadyMeta` metaclass needs to inherit from *all* the metaclasses of the base classes it's applied to.

1.  **Identify the metaclass of `BaseLLMProvider`:** You'll need to inspect the `BaseLLMProvider` class definition. Look for `metaclass=` in its definition or in its base classes. If it's a Pydantic `BaseModel` (which is common for LLM providers), its metaclass will be `pydantic.main.ModelMetaclass` (or similar for Pydantic v2). If it's an `ABC` class, its metaclass is `abc.ABCMeta`.

2.  **Make `NotReadyMeta` inherit from the conflicting metaclass(es):** Once you know the metaclass of `BaseLLMProvider`, you'll need to modify `NotReadyMeta` to inherit from it.

**Example (assuming `BaseLLMProvider` uses `pydantic.main.ModelMetaclass`):**

```python
from pydantic.main import ModelMetaclass # Or wherever the metaclass for BaseLLMProvider is defined

class NotReadyMeta(ModelMetaclass): # <--- Inherit from the conflicting metaclass
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, dct):
        for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():
            if callable(attr_value) and not attr_name.startswith('__'):
                dct[attr_name] = NotReadyMeta.raise_not_implemented_wrapper(attr_value)
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, dct)

    @staticmethod
    def raise_not_implemented_wrapper(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            raise NotImplementedError(f"Class '{args[0].__class__.__name__}' is not ready for use yet. Method '{func.__name__}' is not implemented.")
        return wrapper

# Assuming BaseLLMProvider is defined elsewhere and has its own metaclass
# class BaseLLMProvider(ABC): # Example if it's an ABC
#     pass

# Or if it's a Pydantic BaseModel:
# from pydantic import BaseModel
# class BaseLLMProvider(BaseModel):
#     pass

class OpenRouterProvider(BaseLLMProvider, metaclass=NotReadyMeta):
    """OpenRouter provider"""
    def __init__(self, model: str = "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", **kwargs):
        # Even if __init__ is overridden, it will still raise if not handled.
        # If you want __init__ to be usable, you'd need to explicitly exclude it in NotReadyMeta
        # or implement it fully here.
        super().__init__(model=model, **kwargs) # Call base class __init__
        raise NotImplementedError("OpenRouterProvider is not ready for use yet.") # This would be redundant if all methods are wrapped


    def call_llm(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        pass # This method will be wrapped by NotReadyMeta
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Order of bases:** While often not strictly necessary for this specific metaclass conflict, in general, when merging metaclasses, the order of inheritance in the custom metaclass can matter for Method Resolution Order (MRO).
* **Built-in types and their metaclasses:** `type` is the default metaclass for all classes. If `BaseLLMProvider` doesn't explicitly define a metaclass, its metaclass is `type`. `ABC` classes have `abc.ABCMeta` as their metaclass. Pydantic `BaseModel` has `pydantic.main.ModelMetaclass`.
* **Selectivity:** If you only want *some* methods to raise `NotImplementedError` and others to work (e.g., `__init__` or configuration methods), your `NotReadyMeta` would need more sophisticated logic to *not* wrap certain methods. The current `NotReadyMeta` wraps *all* callable methods not starting with `__`.

## User

what if i remove "and not attr_name.startswith('__')" and just leave at "if callable(attr_value):", what will happen? give a short answer

## Model

If you remove `and not attr_name.startswith('__')`, your `NotReadyMeta` metaclass will attempt to wrap all callable attributes, **including special "dunder" methods** like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, etc. This will likely break core Python functionality, as these methods are expected to behave in specific ways and directly raising `NotImplementedError` within them will prevent basic object creation, representation, and other built-in operations.
If you remove `and not attr_name.startswith('__')` and just leave `if callable(attr_value):`, your metaclass will attempt to wrap **all callable attributes**, including Python's "dunder" methods (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`, etc.).

This will likely lead to:

1.  **Broken Class Functionality:** Core Python operations that implicitly call dunder methods (like object initialization, string representation, arithmetic operations, etc.) will instead raise `NotImplementedError`. For example, `obj = MyClass()` would immediately fail because `__init__` would be wrapped.
2.  **Unexpected Errors:** You'll encounter `NotImplementedError` in scenarios where Python expects specific dunder methods to function normally for internal operations.
