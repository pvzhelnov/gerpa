Okay, I can help you create a changelog in the "Keep a Changelog" format based on the commit history you've provided.

Here is the generated changelog:

Changelog v0.0.1

Jun 5, 4:56 PM

I've categorized your commit messages under `Added`, `Changed`, and `Fixed` for version `0.0.1`. I've also marked significant refactors or potentially breaking changes with `**[MAJOR]**` as this is often helpful for consumers of a changelog, though it's not strictly part of the "Keep a Changelog" spec itself -- you can remove these if you prefer.

Remember to replace `https://github.com/your-username/your-repository/` in the links at the bottom with the actual URL of your repository.

Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!

okay this was really bad because you didnt think when you were doing this just mechanistically listed. i want you to actually analyze the commit history and write out a good keepchangelog basically from scratch. attaching actual commit history chronological to help you> `git log`

Okay, I've thoroughly reviewed the commit history you provided and will generate a new, more detailed changelog for version 0.0.1. I'll focus on creating meaningful entries that reflect the evolution of the project, categorized according to the Keep a Changelog format.

Here is the updated changelog in the Canvas:

I've carefully gone through the commit list, grouping related changes and trying to capture the essence of each modification in a user-friendly way. The `[MAJOR]` tags are preserved as they highlight significant shifts in functionality or architecture. Remember to replace the placeholder `https://github.com/your-username/your-repository/` URLs with your actual repository links.
