Model: Gemini 2.5 Pro (preview) via gemini.google.com

**Canvas: On**

Copied and pasted chat manually. I did not capture Canvas output nor thinking because it seemed super unnecessary. The final output can be found in CHANGELOG.md (perhaps will revise later on but you can get a relevant commit): https://github.com/pvzhelnov/gerpa/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#001---2025-06-05

## pasted.md

Copied and pasted on 2025-06-06 UTC-4 from here <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/> using <https://web2md.answer.ai/> and trimmed manually.

## git log

`git log` command from initial commit and up until `89a3c5fe534898e9e449d3efe83d8d0e758db0d2` saved into a file.

Then manually edited (find + replace) to get this:

commit <hash>

Author: Your Name <you@example.com>

Not posting the file itself because it is obvious from the git history.
